"Mona in 318 (or alternatively 308) bytes"
A small SNES demo by Revenant/Resistance
   slight size optimization by forarslys
Made in a weekend for Demosplash 2019, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

This is a remake/port of an original 250-byte Atari XL demo by Ilmenit:
http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=62917

The original Atari version uses 250 bytes; this version uses exactly 318 (or 308)
(128 bytes data + 188 (or 178) bytes code + 2-byte reset vector). Similar to the
C64 port by Graham/Oxyron, this version is slightly larger than the original
due to a lack of built-in screen/graphics routines on the SNES.

Tested on NTSC hardware (with sd2snes). Should also work fine with most popular
emulators (except for ZSNES). Builds with ca65.
